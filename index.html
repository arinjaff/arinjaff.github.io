    <h2>Take It On</h2>
    <p>Kids my age tend to be more comfortable with technology and navigating online websites, and often are more adept at it as compared to older populations.</p> 
<p>When my grandparents were recently trying to get Covid Vaccine appointments I saw the level of frustration and lack of success that they were having navigating the online tools. </p>
<p>I realized that this is an area where teens could really make a difference. Right away, I helped several seniors in my own community who needed appointments. I had an easier time navigating the websites and inputting information than my parents and grandparents, and I could fit in little small bursts of time to get the occasional appointment here and there. It became like a rhythm, a constant heartbeat of appointments and browser tabs!</p>

<p>In crew, we use the analogy that the boat can’t move forward unless everyone is rowing together. I think this applies to our world right now. In order to move forward out of this pandemic situation, we need to all work together to get everyone who wants to get vaccinated an opportunity to do so. </p>

<p>I welcome my fellow high school students, and teens everywhere to bring out their tech skills, and reach out to one person you know who is currently eligible to receive the vaccine, wants to get it, and might have difficulty accessing the online scheduling platforms. If everyone helps one person, we could really move the boat forward!</p>

    <h2>Your Power 10</h2>
 <p>1. Only offer to help someone who wants the vaccine and is currently eligible in your area.</p>
<p>2. Reach out to someone you know and trust. Some sites ask for personal information and there should be a high level of trust between you and the person you help.</p>
<p>3. Let the person you are helping know that you will make an effort to help but can’t guarantee that you will cross the finish line. They should still work all venues to get a vaccine appointment.</p>
<p>4. Pace yourself. I find it best to help one person at a time and stay with that person until you are able to get a vaccine appointment.</p>
<p>5. Print out screenshots of appointment details for your senior citizen. Many senior citizens feel more comfortable with a paper appointment reminder.</p>
<p>6. Stay safe. Maintain proper social distancing, and masking. Don’t risk unnecessarily exposing the person you are trying to help.</p>
<p>7. If at all possible, accompany them to the vaccine appointment and help them understand the details of their second vaccine appointment.</p>
<p>8. Communicate with them throughout the process as there is likely a level of anxiety they are experiencing in waiting for the appointment.</p>
<p>9. Network with your friends, everyday there are new opportunities for appointments, share your successes with your friends.</p>
<p>10. Be patient, Be persistent</p>
   
    <h2>Where To Start</h2>
